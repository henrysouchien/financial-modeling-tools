## Mandatory Plan-First Workflow

NO COWBOY CODING. This codebase has carefully designed layers and abstractions. Do NOT make quick fixes, first-glance patches, or lazy code changes — they WILL break things, violate architectural patterns, or produce garbage code.

**ALL code changes MUST follow this workflow:**

1. **Plan first** — enter plan mode, research the codebase, understand the architecture. This is where errors get caught. No exceptions for "it looks simple."
2. **Codex review** — send the plan to Codex for review. Codex catches what Claude misses. Iterate until PASS.
3. **Implement via Codex** — send the approved plan to Codex for implementation. Claude does not write the code directly unless explicitly told to.

**The ONLY exception**: trivial fixes (a few lines, typo-level) that the user expressly approves for direct edit. If in doubt, it's not trivial — plan it.

**Why this exists**: Claude's first instinct is to glance at code and "fix" it. This almost always breaks something, misses architectural context, or produces code that doesn't match the codebase's patterns. The plan→review→implement pipeline forces proper investigation before any code is written.

NEVER edit files in any `-dist` package directory (app-platform-dist, brokerage-connect-dist, claude-gateway-dist, finance-cli-dist, fmp-mcp-dist, ibkr-mcp-dist, portfolio-risk-engine-dist, taskflow-agent-dist, web-app-platform-dist). These are synced deployment repos — always edit the source repo instead. If you need to change code that lives in a -dist package, identify which source repo owns it and make changes there.

NEVER run `git checkout -- <files>`, `git checkout .`, `git checkout HEAD`, `git restore .`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`, or ANY command that discards uncommitted changes. NO EXCEPTIONS. Multiple sessions may be running in parallel. If Codex or any tool modifies unexpected files, TELL the user which files and ASK what to do — do NOT revert them.

# financial-modeling-tools — Synced Package Repo

**DO NOT edit code in this repo directly.**

This repo is a deployment artifact synced from the source of truth at `AI-excel-addin/` (`schema/` and `packages/`). All code changes must be made there first, then synced here using `AI-excel-addin/scripts/sync_financial_modeling_tools.sh`.

See the deploy checklist in the source repo: `AI-excel-addin/docs/DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`
